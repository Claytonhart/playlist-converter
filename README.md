## Playlist Converter

Live version currently hosted at [Playlist Converter](https://claytonhart.github.io/playlist-converter/)

This playlist converter allows for quick conversion of playlists between four platforms.
1. Spotify
2. Youtube
3. Deezer
4. Napster

Unfortunately, many popular music streaming platforms do not have a publicly available client side API. For example, Soundcloud does, but is not accepting any new registrations for API keys as of Sept. 10, 2018. Google Music has an unofficial API which I was hesitant to incorporate for legal and longevity reasons, as the API is likely to break in some way if Google releases an official music API in the future. Amazon music does not have an API official, nor unofficial.

### APIs used in Playlist Converter
